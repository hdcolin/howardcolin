I've always liked the idea of having a separate space to write about work related techncial projects, projects that might be _too technical_, or not completely relevent for our company blog or publications.

The main aim of this blog, is to provide me with a platform that I can write about what I have learned. I feel that being able to write and explain things for other people is a good way to increase understanding of the subject. As well as providing a repository of articles that I can look back on for reference.

The blog setup is very simple. It's a Hugo site, running the simplest theme I could find. I write in Markdown and push to Github, where a Cloudflare worker takes over and builds and publishes the website. I may tweak the theme or settings, improving things as I go.

RSS should be working. There are two feeds:
- [Main Feed](https://howardcolin.co.uk/index.xml) - This contains everything on the site (Pages, and Posts)
- [Posts Feed](https://howardcolin.co.uk/posts/index.xml) - This contains just the posts.

I've got some post ideas to come:
- I've been working on a colour science project and I've learned about referencing 3D coordinates from flat arrays. I want to do a post on this and break it down, so I really understand how it works.
- I'm working through a simple matrix math library in C. I'm following along from a tutorial, but making some tweaks along the way.
- Some more post-production, image workflow for film and tv related experiments, these are mostly in Golang and maybe some Python / C.
- Some posts on Golang and concurrency which I am also working through.

Any questions, other ideas let me know!
