This is a small website where I jot down my ideas and write about my projects. Most of my technical projects are related to my work in TV and Film. I also enjoy learning new technologies and software, which always seems to track back into my work related experiments.

 Outside of work I enjoy classic 4x4s, music, backpacking and wild-camping.
